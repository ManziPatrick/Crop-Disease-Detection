**Crop Disease Detection with Streamlit**

Crop Disease Detection is a web application developed to identify and classify diseases in crop images
using a pre-trained deep learning model. 
The application is built with Streamlit and utilizes
a convolutional neural network (CNN) model created with TensorFlow and Keras.

**#Features**
Image Upload: Users can upload images of crops to the web application for disease detection.
Disease Classification:
 The application uses a pre-trained CNN model to classify
the uploaded image and identify whether the crop is affected by a disease.
User-Friendly Interface:
 The Streamlit interface is designed to be simple and intuitive,
allowing users to easily interact with the application.
